To run the program:
Make sure Python 3.7+ is installed
Make sure pip is installed; if it isn't, you can install it here https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/
Open CMD and type the following as seperate commands:
pip install tweepy
pip install numpy
pip install python-secrets
pip install pandas
pip install opencv-python
pip install requests
pip install pil
Once you have done that, you have all the necessary libaries to run the program.
You need to get your own API keys. Visit developer.twitter.com to obtain these. Once you have obtained your keys, you copy-paste them into the "secrets.py" file.
Once you have downloaded the files, you open the "input.txt" file, and type the twitter usernames that you want scraped as follows:
Example1
Example2
Example3
Once you have saved that, you run the "followers.py" file. It could take a while to run, depending on how many accounts you have inputed, and your PC's processing power. 
Once it is done running, the "output.csv" file will contain the information you need. 
Good Luck!
